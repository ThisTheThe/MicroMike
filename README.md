Micro Mike: The *smoothest* Obsidian Theme. 

Micro Mike is a high-density retro-style interface with a focus on mouse & eye ergonomics. Try it out and see if you like any of the changes I've made. Only dark mode is supported.

Intended to be used with [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) (found in Community Plugins).
