/* 
	Resizable Resize Bars
	This snippet allows for a configurable width on the "resize handles" that determine the width of the sidebars.
	Why? It's very precise to click the handles normally. If you do that often, you might find it a useful quality-of-life improvement.
	Width value can be configured with Style Settings.
