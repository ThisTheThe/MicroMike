	Mini Mode
	Turn Obsidian into a convenient little notepad - just by resizing it.
	This snippet will cause the sidebars, title bar, and status bar to disappear when the window below a certain width.
	You'll have to change the minimum width that the "mini mode" activates at to your preference manually - this can't be changed in Style Settings due to CSS limitations.
