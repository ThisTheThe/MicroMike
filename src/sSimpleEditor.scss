/* 
	Simple Editor
	This snippet enforces a uniform line-height in the preview + editor, no matter what. I find this "pseudo notepad" environment preferable to the more chaotic, jerky formatting shifts that occur switching between modes otherwise.
	Due to fundamental HTML layout differences, I have to enforce a particular "pretty" note formatting style for this consistency.
