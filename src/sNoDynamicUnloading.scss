/* 
	No Dynamic Unloading
	This snippet disables dynamic unloading on the text editor preview mode and sidebars. 
	Why? The optimization has many problems.
	* Twitchy, unpredictable scrolling.
	* Trouble reaching the end of image-heavy files in preview mode.
	* If elements of tree view are too small, the bottom of them won't render.
	If you're having trouble with things like this, it might make things easier to disable the optimization.

	I'd like to extend support to the Codemirror source / live editor, but I haven't figured out how to circumvent it yet.
