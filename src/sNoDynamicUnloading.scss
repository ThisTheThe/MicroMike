/* 
	No Dynamic Unloading
	This snippet disables dynamic unloading on the text editor preview mode and sidebars. 
	Why? The optimization has many problems.
	* Notes with a lot of image embeds tend to get stuck jumping backwards while scrolling.
	* If you make tree elements unusually small, it's bad at adapting and tends to leave part of the potential space unloaded.
	* Twitchy, unpredictable scrolling, and micro-lag caused when loading/unloading elements.
	If you're having trouble with things like this, it might make things easier to disable the optimization.

	I'd like to extend support to the Codemirror source / live editor, but I haven't figured out how to circumvent it yet.
