/* 
	Left Aligned Readable Line Length
	This snippet will cause the sidebars, title bar, and status bar to disappear when the window is a certain width.
	It is advised the user change the minimum width that the "mini mode" activates to their preference manually - this can't be changed in GUI due to CSS limitations.
