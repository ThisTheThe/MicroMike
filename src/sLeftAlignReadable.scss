/* 
	Left Aligned Readable Line Length
	When using readable line length, this will make the text align against the left side rather than center itself. 
	This can reduce necessary eye movement if you work heavily on the left side of the screen.
	Style settings allows for disabling left alignment, and a general use function for configuring the line length.
