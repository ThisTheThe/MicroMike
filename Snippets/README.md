* sDensePrompt
  * This modifies the prompt window (Ctrl+P) to be more dense; this allows it to display more results.

* sDenseSettings
  *	This makes the settings (both the sidebar and main section) more dense, allowing for more information to be displayed. 
  *	Why? It can often be obnoxious navigating the normal Obsidian settings, which give an excess of spacing to the detriment of seeing the full picture.

* sLeftAlignReadable 
  * When using readable line length, this will make the text align against the left side rather than center itself. 
  * This can reduce necessary eye movement if you work heavily on the left side of the screen.
  * Style settings allows for disabling left alignment, and a general use function for configuring the line length.

* sLeftAlignSettingsControls
  * This makes interactable elements in the settings menu left-aligned, pushing against the text. 
  * It makes it much clearer which interactable belongs to which setting, and elegantly sectionally divides the window.

* sMiniMode
  * Turn Obsidian into a convenient little notepad - just by resizing it.
  * This snippet will cause the sidebars, title bar, and status bar to disappear when the window below a certain width.
  * You'll have to change the minimum width that the "mini mode" activates at to your preference manually - this can't be changed in Style Settings due to CSS limitations.

* sNearerTotalNumbers
  * This modifies how the number in the search, tags, backlinks/outlinks, etc works. 
	 * It moves it to the left	alongside the text, which makes it easier and less ambiguous which number belongs to which entry.

* sNoAnimations
  *	This snippet disables animations. It includes a feature to workaround a problem causing the sidebars to close more slowly.
